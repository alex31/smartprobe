# SMARTPROBE Pitot3D device

Smartprobe is an autonomous pitot3d tube that is designed to be mounted on a drone.
It records relative wind speed and angles, stores them on sdcard, and stream data on a serial line.



#### *Disclaimer : software was still in alpha stage when the project development was stopped in fall 2021*



## Installation


### The easy way
use the latest binary found under GitHub Releases

### You really want to compile it ?
### Dependencies installation 


>cross compilation and Perl library for the boardGen.pl tool :

``` shell
sudo apt install build-essential gcc-arm-none-eabi gdb-multiarch \
         default-jre libmodern-perl-Perl \
	 libxml-libxml-Perl libfile-which-Perl \
	 dfu-util
	 
sudo cpan -i String/LCSS.pm
```
> to use bmpflash when flashing with a Black Magic Probe or Criquet Probe
``` shell
sudo usermod -a -G dialout $USER
```
### optional : stm32cubemx install from stmicroelectronics website:
https://www.st.com/en/development-tools/stm32cubemx.html
(boardGen.pl script needs xml MCU description files)
If stm32cubemx is not found, a pregenerated board.h is used, you won't be able to modify pin assignation


### clone of GitHub repository and submodules :
``` shell
git clone --recursive https://github.com/alex31/smartprobe.git
cd smartprobe
git submodule update --init --recursive
```

### build firmware in release mode
``` shell
make clean; make BUILD=SIZE
```

### flash firmware in release mode
In dfu mode :
plug micro-USB cable (no need to power supply)
``` shell
make BUILD=SIZE dfuflash

```
In swd mode :
plug swd cable (need to power supply smartprobe)
``` shell
make BUILD=SIZE flash
``` 


## Usage

### ÂµSD Card
It is mandatory to install a micro sd card :
- SD should be formatted with FAT32 or ExFAT filesystem.
- configuration is read from SD
- wind data is stored on the SD
- reading/writing SD can be done
  - offline : SD must be removed
  - online : plug the smartprobe via USB (with SD installed) on a computer, and it will be shown like a USB storage device


### Connector J3 at the back
The Molex connector at the back contains  :  
- power in : Vin should be between 7 and 20 Volts
- bootloader mode switch (connect pin5 with pin6, then power up the smartprobe)
  -bootloader mode is to be used to flash the firmware in the smartprobe
- USB to mount the sdcard as a USB storage device
- UART which can be used for multiple purposes (choice is made in configuration file)

### Parameters
- firmware parameters are read from the SD at start, in a file named ***smartprobe.conf***
- if a file named smartprobe.conf is not found, it will be created, all the fields set at their default value
- the most accurate and up-to-date definitions (with default and range) for each field can be found in source file  
*source/confParameters.hpp*
- here is a list of parameters (details are missing, confParameters.hpp reading is advised)

## Calibration
Smartprobe should be calibrated in a wind tunnel before use. The calibration matrix values should then be written in the configuration file instead of the default values.

### Calibration procedure :
...TO BE WRITTEN...


## Development tool
there is a SWD connector on the PCB for connecting a debug probe (Black Magic Probe or STlink V2/V3) which permits debugging with gdb and access to a shell console

## Ideas for future developments 
- If external componant (autopilot) stream gps positions and heading, wind in a terrestrial reference frame could be calculated on board
- add USB CDC endoint to the existing USB storage endpoint to output serial console shell via USB
- stream UAVCAN messages on the CAN 2.0B interface
